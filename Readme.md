## Kruskal's Algorithm using HTML Canvas

> Algorithm is in Python and App uses a POST request to the Flask api.
# Algorithm
The algorithm is a Greedy Algorithm. The Greedy Choice is to pick the smallest weight edge that does not cause a cycle in the MST constructed so far.

Below are the steps for finding MST using Kruskalâ€™s algorithm:
1. Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.
2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it.
3. Repeat step#2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.
